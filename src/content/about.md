Hello! I'm Lewis, a software engineer based in Sizewell, United Kingdom who enjoys building things that interact with people. I've always been the go-to tech person in my family and started coding by customizing my Tumblr blog (good old times right?). Besides my passion for technology, I love to travel, music, tv shows, and probably a lot of other things I can't remember right now. When not working you can most likely find me outdoors mingling with other humans!

In my free time, I like to listening music and play football & basketball I love, wherever that may be! Also, my dog `Peny` is my best friend and we've been on a crazy ride together for 20 years now. ðŸ¤
